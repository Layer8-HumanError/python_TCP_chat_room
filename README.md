# python_TCP_chat_room

This is a rudimentary chat room application that I implemented in Python. 
The provided program files can be executed within a Command Prompt (CMD) environment. 
They rely on your localhost address for the establishment of a chat room 'server' and for you,
as a user, to connect to this server.

When you join the chat room, you have the opportunity to designate your own distinctive nickname. 
This nickname is used to identify you as the sender of each message. You can then engage in 
conversation with other connected clients, contributing to the interactive nature of the chat room.

This project offers valuable learning experiences for those interested in network programming and socket 
communication. By exploring these codebases, you can gain insights into the fundamental concepts of establishing 
a TCP connection between a client and a server. It provides a practical illustration of socket programming in Python, 
offering insights into socket creation, binding, listening, and accepting connections.

Furthermore, this project also touches on the implementation of multithreading. Each connected client runs in its own 
thread, allowing for concurrent communication without blocking the main execution thread. This is an important concept
for anyone interested in building scalable network applications.

In summary, this Python chat room project can serve as an educational tool for you, providing hands-on experience in creating 
a chat application, handling client-server interactions, and understanding the principles of network communication and multithreading.
